HTML5 Canvas experiments

## Description
Exploring Canvas drawing without any third party libraries. There are some simple and easy to follow examples here.

* Planets: How planets move in an elliptic orbit. See [Orbital motion](https://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Smotion.htm).
* Gravity: shooting a ball into the air, and see it bounce back. Flips color according to vertical direction.
* Mandelbrot set: Calculates and draws the Mandelbrot set. Zoom in by clicking in the canvas to select center point, and press up arrow to zoom in. Down arrow zooms out. Navigate arond using a,w,s,z. Finally, as zoom is increased it can be handy to increase the Mandelbrot iteration count. Use right arrow to increase, left to decrease.
